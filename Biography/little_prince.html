<div style="width:350px">
    As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
    <span class="group1">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
    <span class="group2">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
    In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
    his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
    <span class="group3">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</span>

    <span class="group3">
        "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a
        flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when
        he is asleep..."
    </span>
    And I felt him to be more fragile still.
    <span class="group1">
        I felt the need of protecting him, as if himself were a flame that might be extinguished
        by a little puff of wind...
